# About
A personal portfolio that uses HTML, CSS, and JS. Index.html has general information about myself, links to my github, linkedin, and resume. As well as two of my biggest projects. Portfolio page has projects that I've worked on and completed (not listed in any particular order). Contact page has a form that can be completed to contact me. 

# Running Application
Since the portfolio only uses html you can just open it in your browser after clonging the repo and run it.
